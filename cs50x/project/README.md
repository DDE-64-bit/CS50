# SafePass, The password generator

Hi! I'm your Olivier Hartsuiker and I'm a 14 years old boy from The Netherlands.  I have created a highly configurable password generator. And all of this for my cs50x final project. I have always that if i need a password i would search for a online generator, so i tought maybe i can create one myself. And here we are.

#### Files

My final project has three files: a css, a html and a javascript file. I have worked the most on the JavaScript file, also a lot on the css file.

#### CSS

I have in the css file written the types of styles. I tought that a somewhat aquablue and white theme would be nice. I realy love the bar beneath the generated password because it blend in so well with all the other colors. A other thing i really like is that the checkboxes turn blue when there're checked (i have worked to long on that useless feature). And all of the hovers are in that file, so if you hover with your mouse over a button the color changes a little bit and the button gets a small shadow.

#### HTML

On the html side of this program i have choosen to build a simple to use gui what also looks good. it was pretty easy to find a good layout. I have gone with a simple gui in the middel of the page, so it's easy to use, and easy to find out how to use the password generator.

#### Javascript

And now the program side of this generator. In the start of the script i import all of the features and some libery's.
Then i have a part where I have created a **const** in that **const** are all of the lower and upper case letters, numbers and all of the symbols.
Then the program will create a long string of characters (30 in total) and then looks at the input for amount of characters (**i**), and then takes the first **i** amount of characters form the generated 30, and displays it on the textbox (untypeble).
Then it looks how strong the password is and gives it a secure rating, 1 to 100 and then checks it with a switch case back what safety color it gets.

I haven't created the copie button, I took it from a public google api.

#### Create files and folders

The file explorer is accessible using the button in left corner of the navigation bar. You can create a new file by clicking the **New file** button in the file explorer. You can also create folders by clicking the **New folder** button.


#### What have i learned

I have learned a lot from this course, i knew some stuff before but now i feel confident that i can make what i think of. I should have taken this course a lot earlyer, even i'm just 14 years old.
